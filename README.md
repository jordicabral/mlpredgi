Building a Function with different Machine Learning algorithms.

This function runs different machine learning algorithms to predict gene intereaction based on the other variables of the dataset.

This function compares different regression models like Linear Regression and some machine learning algorithms: K-NN, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest, and shows the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of them to compare the performance with different parameters.

The function splits also the dataset in training and test with a proportion of 67-33/100 sample rows, to make the training and validation of each machine learning algorithm.

The function allows also the possibility to exclude one or some variables in the model.
